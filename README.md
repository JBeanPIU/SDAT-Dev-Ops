A program created using Maven in Intellij! The main purpose of this is to be a library management system, storing books and user data in a small interactive menu. Using JUnit 5 for testing purposes

All files MUST be kept together for the program to work properly.

Side note for Jamie (prof), I'm not sure how clean this code may be so please correct me on anything I missed! I like using /* === */ in my assignments because I personally find it hard to read code when it isn't sectioned in a specific way. 
So I usually tend to add long lines for whole new sections (in this case, the methods in LibraryManagement.java to the user menu loop) and small ones for sub-sections inside a group (separating the book information from the user and menu code respectively)
